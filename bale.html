<h1><pre>
Gareth Frank Bale born on 16 July 1989 is a Welsh professional footballer 
who plays as a winger for Spanish club Real Madrid and the Wales national team. 
Renowned for his ball striking from distance, swerving free kicks and 
his ability to get past defenders with pace.

Bale has received plaudits from his peers, who have described him as a footballer
with "tremendous speed, great crossing ability, a great left foot and 
exceptional physical qualities".

He began his professional career at Southampton,
playing at left-back and earning acclaim as a free kick specialist. 

Bale moved to Tottenham Hotspur in 2007, for an eventual £7 million fee. 
During his time at Tottenham, managerial and tactical shifts saw him 
transform into a more attacking player. 

Bale became an integral part of the team, rising to international attention
during the 2010–11 UEFA Champions League.</pre></h2>
